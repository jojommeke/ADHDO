## About ADHDO:

ADHDO is made to motivate users (with ADHD) to do certain todos that have deadlines and help them accomplish them efficiently.



## How it works:

ADHDO is just like any other todo app **BUT** with a catch:

- Deadlines for todos are visually presented in comparison with the users progress

- The user can change how important certain parts of tasks are

- The user gets tips/help about what todos are more important (at the moment)

- Made by someone with ADHD

- see the website and test out for yourself! jojommeke.github.io/ADHDO

- it's free!
